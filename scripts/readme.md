# Scripts

Scripts for convenient operations like:

* Convert cube from SEG-Y to HDF5 file format for faster model training

* Compute quality map to locate the hardest places of the seismic data

* Assess horizons: create multiple metric images with detailed information

* Build a complete report on a set of horizons and scarce carcasses to evaluate interpolation models
