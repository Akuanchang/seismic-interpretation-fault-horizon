Multiple approaches to horizon detection (each in its own directory):

* Inter-cube generalization aims at training and testing at different sets of cubes

* Carcass interpolation allows to enlarge a sparse grid of labels to a whole seismic range

* Horizon extrapolation solves the task of extending small continuous labeled pathc to a whole seismic range

* Interlayer segmentation solves the task of horizon detection as the task of segmenting thick subterranean structures
